The stack is:

    2x M3 -->
      Eyepiece_1.stl
      (3mm sheet)
      Eyepiece 2.stl
      Phone_1.stl (M3 nut)
      Phone_2.stl
    <-- 2x #2 x 7/8"

This holds a Nexus 5X with the printed parts sandwiching a 3mm printed plastic
sheet.  It's not super sturdy, but withstood 3 days.

The pieces all print without support, but the `Phone_2.stl` requires a bit of
knife/sanding to get the strings out and the fit perfect.
